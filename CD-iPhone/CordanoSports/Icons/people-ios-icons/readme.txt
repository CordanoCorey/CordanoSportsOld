People Icons for iOS

People Icons for IOS offer iPhone, iPad, and iPod
developers a quick and easy way to create stunning navigation bars,
toolbars, and tab bars in their apps. Numerous raster and vector
options are available to accommodate the latest super-high resolution
Retina displays used in iPhone and similar Apple devices. Thanks to
the high-pixel count and scalable vector versions available, App Tab
Bar Icons for iPhone will look edgy and three-dimensional. All icons
have controllable depth that can be adjusted with an extra
Alpha-channel layer. The App Tab Bar Icons for iPhone collection
includes images one's likely to encounter in toolbars and navigation
bars used in iPhone, iPad, and iPod apps.

Technically, developers receive 122 unique app icons drawn in matching
